For the departmenmts. Lets remove the leads for TS David Chen. He doesn't exists. We do not need him. TN, TS AA do not need a lead. That level 1 is just there for reports across a division. No tech lead. If you HAVE TO HAVE one lets use Dave Cornelius as the PM for the role.

Make up 2 more cases just like Gerrit-Daniel Stich. These two have already a LPR and are Bhaskaran Rathaksishana the TSA lead. It's a finished case , as well as Arnaud Borner the TSM lead. He has a finished case. It's done. Similar to gerrit stich. 

Everyone of these can also be users except Jacob because he is a prospective hire. we are in the approval stage, case submitted for approval but PM has not approved yet. 


Now let  me give you some information about visa cases that we can create: 


Brandon: In approval stage for EB2NIW PM has not yet approved. 
David Craig Penner: PM has approved, HR has not yet scheduled meetings
Timothy: In approval stage, PM has approved. Will go forward with marriage based petition, make up data  
Luis: Has an approved EB2NIW case and actually received his I-140 2 weeks ago, has started the I-485 paperwork now in collection 
Kiran: Just filed his I140 
Victor: Has a fully approved LPR got it throughj EB2-NIW so lets make up some steps. Dates in table give you some idea. rest make up
Tove: She has a draft stage of an EB-2NIW application but not yet submitted for approval 
Jacon: As mentioned before. He has an approved H1B application but HR has not scheduled meetings yet. 
Georgios: Just got his PERM approved for his EB2 application , now in pipeline for preparing I-140 documents with Goel & Anderson law firm
David Perez: In the pipeline for filing his EB2-NIW draft stage for approval for PM
Bashkaran and Arnaud: As mentioned they have approved LPRS same as victor. 
Gerrit-Daniel Stich: Did EB3 and has it approved. 


If we need other data lets please make it up, but maybe the completely fake data we should keep in the top level dev seedingf script? Maybe clean up whats in that one as well. Just do what makes sense. For made up cases lets confirm first. If we have missing data in the ones I have give here lets make loghical dates up.
